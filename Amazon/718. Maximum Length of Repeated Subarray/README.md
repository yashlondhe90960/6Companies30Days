# Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray
## Description

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays.
 

Example 1:


```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,2,1], nums2 = [3,2,1,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3,2,1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [0,0,0,0,0], nums2 = [0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 5
Explanation: The repeated subarray with maximum length is [0,0,0,0,0].
